# [](#open-source)Open Source

I have a few open source projects I work on outside of [my professional career](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenpease/), so I've made this page to briefly describe them.

## [](#mbti-flashcards)MBTI Flashcards

The [MBTI Flashcards](https://github.com/svpease/mbti-flashcards) JavaScript application was created to help me study the foundational concepts behind the 16 personalities described by the [Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator) regarding each type's ordered cognitive functions:
* Ni (Introverted Intuition/Perspectives)
* Te (Extroverted Thinking/Effectiveness)
* Fi (Introverted Feeling/Authenticity)
* Se (Extroverted Sensing/Sensation)
* Ne (Extroverted Intuition/Exploration)
* Ti (Introverted Thinking/Accuracy)
* Fe (Extroverted Feeling/Harmony)
* Si (Introverted Sensing/Memory)

> The cognitive functions described above are paired with their more colloquial terms borrowed from [PersonalityHacker.com](https://personalityhacker.com).

The application shows flashcards pertaining to each of the 16 personality types that list said types' cognitive functions.

These flashcards have a few handy features such as..
* they can be sorted by strongest cognitive function (by clicking on a cognitive function listed),
* have their cognitive functions toggled invisible by pressing the "H" key (for memorization/studying),
* and selectively shown using a textbox type filter.

**Type Filter**
* When the type filter is, for example..
    * **INJ**, all INXJ personality types are shown: INTJ, INFJ
    * **INTJ**, only the INTJ type is shown
    * **IN**, it lists four types: INTJ, INTP, INFJ, INFP, and so on..
* The type filter prevents any erroneous input that would not make sense.
* The type filter may also be comma-delimited so that types can be shown side-by-side (for example "INTJ,ESTJ" or "INJ,ESTJ").

I spend considerable amount of personal time researching psychology and personality types (mostly through MBTI and the Enneagram).

When I'm geeking out and sharing my MBTI knowledge, I'm usually sharing posts or commenting in the [INFJ + INTJ Relationships](https://www.facebook.com/groups/infjintjrelationships/) Facebook Group, which I admin.

## [](#jquery-json-presenter)JSON Presenter (jQuery Plugin)

The [JSON Presenter jQuery plugin](https://github.com/svpease/jquery-json-presenter) that I wrote in JavaScript helps me to build more effective tools, allowing me to quickly see and access structured JSON data.

This has been particularly helpful for tools that aid troubleshooting and has saved a lot of time, whereas building a custom UI for every bit of structured JSON data being passed back and forth in JavaScript would be particularly tedious.

This plugin allows for jQuery to very quickly select a DOM element and provide it with the JSON to be presented within said container DOM element.

Options may be provided to the plugin that specify how many levels deep to expand/collapse collapsible JSON properties (such as Arrays and Objects).

The user interface also allows collapsible properties to be expanded/collapsed by clicking on said JSON property.
